The analysis is split into two main parts, both using data on stock returns and revenue from pre-, during, and post-COVID periods to pull insights.

The first takes a look at Pop Culture companies like Netflix, Funko, Kartoon Studios, Sony (Crunchyroll), Disney, GameStop, Hasbro, Warner Bros.	Here, we see that digital-first (Netflix) and Distributor (Funko) models were more resilient and showed better revenue growth than Producers (Kartoon Studios) during the crisis.

Part two looks at Lifestyle Companies like Nike, Lululemon, Peloton, Sprouts Farmers Market, Home Depot, Starbucks. This showed an overwhelming trend, illustrating that lifestyle companies were ones that were able to adapt (e.g., strong drive-thru, home fitness, DIY) and so thrived. Companies that failed to plan ahead (e.g., Peloton, Funko) saw a post-lockdown decline.


The documents conclude that Cooledtured is well-positioned as a digitally native, distributor/lifestyle company, but must focus on these areas:

1. Building Community: Cooledtured must focus on keeping and growing its "tribe" (fan base) through visible, interactive social media campaigns, similar to the success factors of platforms like Crunchyroll and Netflix.

2. Doubling Down on Digitalization: The company needs to lean into digital storefronts, diversify suppliers for a flexible supply chain, and increase its international reach to become recession-resistant.

3. Riding Cultural Waves: The strategy should be to find a cultural wave and ride it, offering timed collections and tracking upcoming trends, as entertainment remains a reliable escape in hard times (the "lipstick effect").

4. Learn from Failure: I advise against making the "critical error" of assuming pandemic-era demand will last. We can see these through failures of companies like Peloton and Funko due to a lack of foresight and poor adaptation.
